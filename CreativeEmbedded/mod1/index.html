                    In the spirit of Valentine's Day, I thought it would be rather funny and neat if I could find a way
                    to make
                    an installation that poked fun at love in one way or another. Coincidentally, I had seen a clip
                    online
                    of two
                    circles arguing with each other about why they couldn't be together because they were unable to love
                    each other.
                    It was kind of weird but also funny, so I decided to do something in this sort of spirit for my
                    project. Thus,
                    <span class="cool-text">A Love Story About Two Circles</span> was born and I set off on making my
                    vision come to life!
                    <img src="images/setup.jpeg" class="img-fluid mt-2">
                    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                        <img src="images/firstslide.jpeg" class="img-fluid d-flex mt-2 mb-2">
                    </div>
                    I began by bringing one of my circle friends to life. Using some functions from the TFT Graphics
                    Library,
                    I was able to draw a circle who, sitting in the corner of the screen, would look up and
                    ask their fellow shape: <span class="cool-text">"Do you love me?"</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From here I was in a little bit of a problem. I knew my own jokes to this probably wouldn't be that
                    funny,
                    so with the help of some friends, I made a list of potential responses that the other circle could
                    give.

                    The plan was to let the ESP randomly choose which one it would say at random. To me this supplied
                    part of the generative element to the piece, as the jokes/answers varied in topic. Some classmates
                    reacted with comments like "It's like you're watching a tiktok with a different punchline every
                    time," which I thought fit the spirit of the piece as a lighthearted fun way of using technology to
                    tell a story about two shapes who may or may not be in love.
                    <img src="images/gen1slide.jpeg" class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-2">
                    This was a fun way of getting familiar with the ESP32 microcontroller and the TFT Graphics
                    that came with the screen. While I ultimately settled on simple shapes, the opportunity to explore
                    what the library had to offer was a great way of preparing myself for the rest of my adventures with
                    the ESP32, particularly because installing the library to begin with was a challenge in itself!
                    As my classmates had also experienced, it was difficult to get the dependencies to communicate with
                    the ESP32 was a little bit of a challenge, especially on older hardware.

                    <span class="cool-text">In all, it was a great time. And I enjoyed making jokes about two circles in love--that part was fun
                    too! </span>
