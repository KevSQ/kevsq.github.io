    <h2>DTMF Tones</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">
      My experience making DTMF tones was thankfully pretty straightforward. I understood from listening to the tones that
      there were two tones being layered together but I wasn't entirely sure which tones. Thankfully, it was pretty easy to
      find a Dual Tone Multi-Frequency frequency map which shows how the 3x4 grid of numbers corresponds is broken up into
      groups of low frequency and high frequency tones. From my understanding, this distinct dichotomy between the tones
      was extremely important since the technology to detect the tones was sensitive and as such, minimizing harmonic
      interference was absolutely essential to the technology working properly.
      <br>
      <br>
      To make the tones, I simply implemented the DTMF map in Javascript by creating two OSCs and then applied a LPF @ 8000Hz. In hindsight,
      it might've been more fun to try and guess the tones since that was honestly probably the most significant component!
      <br>
      <br>
      To sort of make up for that fact and to really bring it to life, I made a little dial pad that plays the tones exactly
      as expected.
